## 🧩 Problem Overview

| File         | Concept                      | Description |
|--------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| `prob1.py`   | Square Calculation            | Calculates the square of a number using a simple function. |
| `prob2.py`   | Multiple Parameters           | Accepts and processes multiple parameters. |
| `prob3.py`   | Type Safety + Multiplication  | Multiplies only if inputs are valid types (using `isinstance`). |
| `prob4.py`   | Circle Metrics                | Computes area and circumference using the `math` module. |
| `prob5.py`   | Default Arguments             | Demonstrates default parameter values in functions. |
| `prob6.py`   | Lambda Function               | Shows use of anonymous functions for quick calculations. |
| `prob7.py`   | `*args`                       | Accepts and sums variable-length positional arguments. |
| `prob8.py`   | `**kwargs`                    | Handles keyword arguments and prints them. |
| `prob9.py`   | Generator                     | Yields even numbers efficiently using `yield`. |
| `prob10.py`  | Recursion                     | Calculates factorial using a recursive approach. |
